A free particle represented by a Gaussian wave packet with a negative statistical
correlation between the position and momentum can have a decreasing position
uncertainty (or wave packet contraction) for a finite duration. We numerically simulate
particle scattering in such a Gaussian state with a step potential barrier to see if the
contraction is still present. The time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE) was solved
using the Crank-Nicolson (C-N) method implemented in the Python programming
language. We show that with a negative position-momentum correlation, the incident
Gaussian wave packet and the reflected wave packet both exhibit a persistent contractive
behavior. This particle localization suggests that more precise position measurements
during barrier scattering events beyond the standard quantum limit is possible.
